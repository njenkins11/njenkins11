### Hello!

Welcome to my Github! Here I normally work on personal projects. These projects vary greatly with one another, as I enjoy learning about different languages and frameworks.
If you want to reach me about anything, reach me through LinkedIn. Thanks!

-Languages I'm most proficient in (greatest to least): Java, Python, C#, C, C++, Assembly x86

-Currrently working on the pinned repositories. Gatekeeper is Java SpringHibernate, Ragnaroster is Django Python Webapp, and Voxel Tower Defense is a Unity C# game. Feel free to take a look at them!
