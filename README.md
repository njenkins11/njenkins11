### Hello!

Welcome to my Github! Here I normally work on personal projects. These projects vary greatly with one another, as I enjoy learning about different languages and frameworks. From modding games such as Minecraft, to creating CRUDS based applications, I'm open to try and learn anything!
If you want to reach me about anything, reach me through LinkedIn. Thanks!

-Languages I'm most proficient in (greatest to least): Java, Python, C#, C, C++, Assembly x86

-Tools I use on my personal projects: Docker, Postman, Maven, Unity Engine

-Currrently working on the pinned repositories. Gatekeeper is a Java Spring-Hibernate FAT application, Ragnaroster is Django Python Webapp, and Voxel Tower Defense is a Unity C# game. Feel free to take a look at them!
